Solved albeit with poor structure and speed.

Procedure:

    Take a list of the integers 1 through 999,999,999.

    Write out each integer in English, so that you have 999,999,999 strings.

    Sort the strings using alphabetical order.

    Concatenate them all into one big string.

    Take the first 51 billion (51,000,000,000) letters of this big string.

Problem:

    What is the last letter in your string?

    What is the last number named in your string? (Hint: your string will end at the end of a number.)

    What is the sum of all the numbers named in your string?
